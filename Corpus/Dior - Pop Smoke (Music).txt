[Intro]
Traphouse Mob


Huh, roll another one
Said I'm never lackin', always pistol packing (This is a Melo beat)
With them automatics, we gon' send him to heaven (Huh)
Wait, wait, wait, wait, ayy, ayy, woo (Aw,), huh
Oh, you feelin' sturdy, huh? (You feelin' sturdy, man)


Shake some', huh
Shake it, huh, shake it, huh, shake it, huh


[Chorus]
She like the way that I dance
She like the way that I move
She like the way that I rock
She like the way that I woo


And she let it clap for a
(She let it clap for a)
And she throw it back for a
(Yeah, she throw it back for a)
Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri

[Verse]
When I walk in the spot, thirty on me


Buy out the club, know that I'm paid, I'm a thot, get me lit


I can't with these 'cause is
All on my page suckin'
All in my comments and screamin' my name


While I'm in the club, throwin' them hundreds and fifties and ones and ones
Pop Smoke, they know I'm wildin'
If I'm on the island, I'm' the cell
Brody got locked, denied his bail (Woo)
Until he free, I'm raisin' hell


Tell my shooters call me FaceTime
For all the times we had to face time


Free D-Nice, he doin' state time


If you need the glizzy, you could take mine


Please don't come out your mouth, you know I'm like that
I'll make a movie like TNT (Baow)


Glock-30 on me, ask who really want it
I bet I air it like BNB


Nappy Blue wildin' in my section


And I keep that .38 for the weapon


Remember when I came home from corrections (Uh-huh)
All the bad in my direction (Uh)




[Chorus]
She like the way that I dance
She like the way that I move
She like the way that I rock
She like the way that I woo
And she let it clap for a
(She let it clap for a)
And she throw it back for a
(Yeah, she throw it back for a)
